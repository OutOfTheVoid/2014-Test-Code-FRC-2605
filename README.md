FRC Team 2605 Sehome Seamonster's 2014 Test Code
================================================
My name is Liam Taylor, and i'm the Programming Department's Head for my FRC team, the Sehome Semonsters. This is test code for the 2014 game. This repository is used only for development. Please feel free to use any of our code! ( Just keep in mind it's not gaurenteed to work correctly by any stretch of the imagination. )

Right now i'm working on the CANJaguarServer, a thread-safe CANJaguar control library.
